# ChessProject
This Python Project has been done in the InnoLab of Continental. 
It is made for a UR10 Cobot, connecting to it via ur-rtde.

Needed libraries:
ur-rtde, python-chess

To connect to the cobot you need to switch the first 3 numbers of the IP address of your Notebook
so that they are similar to those numbers of the IP address provided by the cobot.

There are three versions:
First: reading a pgn file and cobot plays the game shown
Second: playing against the cobot while you move your pieces
Third: playing against the cobot while the cobot moves your pieces
